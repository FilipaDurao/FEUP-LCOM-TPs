### Notes:
All the Labs and the final project developed in this course were in full collaboration with my lab partener, Filipa Dur찾o (FilipaDurao , https://github.com/FilipaDurao).
This course's grade is only based on the evaluation of the laboratories and final project. For this reason, the course's teachers are very straight when it comes to copying code: They have a good algorithm that finds if you are re-using code from me or from any other student that has already completed the course. Thus, I strongly advise you to not copy any code: The punishments are from 0 in the Lab grade to instantly failing the Curricular Unit. Be honest and don't cheat.
Also, some of the libraries and header files in this repository were not developed by me or by my co-worker, they were developed and handed to us by the curricular unit teachers.
